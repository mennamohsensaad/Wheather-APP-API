## project Introduction
  ### This project aims to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.


## Project Environment Setup
 *  **Node and Express Environment** :-Node and Express  installed on the local machine.The Express app instance pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.

 * **Local Server** :-  Local server  running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function.

 *  **API Credentials** :- API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com.
     

 ##    APIs and Routes.
 *  **APP API Endpoint**:- There  a JavaScript Object named projectData initiated in the file `server.js` to act  as the app API endpoint.
    

*   **Integrating OpenWeatherMap API**:- the personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API is saved in variable  and The API Key variable is passed as a parameter to fetch().Data is successfully returned from the external API.
   

*  **Return Endpoint Data GET Route I: Server Side**:-  a GET route setup on the server side with the first argument as a string naming the route, and the second argument a callback function to return the JS object created at the top of server code.
   

* **Return Endpoint Data GET Route II: Client Side**:-  an asynchronous function is used to fetch the data from the app endpoint.
    
*  **POST Route**:- add an entry to the project endpoint using a POST route setup on the server side and executed on the client side as an asynchronous function.The client side function  take two arguments, the URL to make a POST to, and an object holding the data to POST.The server side function create a new entry in the apps endpoint consisting of the data received from the client side POST.
    

##  Dynamic UI
* **Event Listeners**:- an event listener to an existing HTML button from DOM using Vanilla JS.
In the file `app.js`, the element with the id of generate should have an `addEventListener()` method called on it, with click as the first parameter, and a named callback function as the second parameter.

*  **Dynamically Update UI** :- Set the properties of existing HTML elements from the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript.
Included in the async function to retrieve that appâ€™s data on the client side, existing DOM elements should have their innerHTML properties dynamically set according to data returned by the app route.


   

## Instructions
  to run server you need  to install  express,cors, body-parser  package  ,this all define on `package.json` file so 
  * Run  `npm inatall` command line in terminal of right directory of project to install needed package.
  * Run server by `npm start` command line.
  * Go to broswer and on `http://localhost:8080/` The server will run APP.
